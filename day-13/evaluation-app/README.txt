# Assignment Instructions

## Objective
Your task is to extract a provided archive, move files into the correct directory structure, fix all bugs in the code (SQL, CSS, JS, HTML, and EJS), test the application, and submit the final working project.

Follow the steps below carefully:

---

## 1. Extract the Files
- Extract the provided project archive into a fresh project folder named `spelling-game-project`.
- Ensure that the extracted files are located in the project directory, and no other nested directories exist.

## 2. Move Files to the Correct Directory Structure
Move the files into the following directory structure:

## 3. Install Necessary Dependencies
Once the directory structure is correct, you need to install the required Node.js modules.

## 4. Fix Bugs
You need to fix the bugs that have been deliberately introduced across all files, including:

- **SQL queries** in `db.js` and `nodeapp.js`.
- **CSS errors** in `style.css`.
- **JavaScript logic issues** in `app.js` (client-side JavaScript).
- **HTML and EJS template errors** in `layout.ejs`, `index.ejs`, and `game.ejs`.

### Areas to Focus On:
- **SQL**: Pay attention to query syntax, missing or incorrect clauses, and table names.
- **CSS**: Ensure correct styling for elements like background color, text color, etc.
- **JavaScript**: Fix logical issues such as incorrect jQuery selectors, incorrect variable usage, or wrong event handling.
- **EJS and HTML**: Correct issues in template includes, broken links, and form handling.

## 5. Test the Application
Once you've fixed all the bugs, test the application to ensure it runs correctly.

## 6. Clean Up the Project
Before submitting the project, you must remove unnecessary files to reduce the project's size. Remove node_modules

## 7. Recompress the Project for Submission
Once you've completed the fixes and removed the node_modules folder, select all remaining project files and folders (including the /public, /views, and all .js, .ejs, .json files).

- Compress them into a .zip archive.
- Name the archive in the following format: yourname_spelling-game_project.zip.
- Ensure that no files are missing from the compressed archive, and do a final check of the file structure.

## 8. Submit Your Project
- Log in to the LMS (Learning Management System) used for the course.
- Find the relevant assignment submission section.
- Upload the .zip archive you created in Step 7.
- Make sure to submit before the assignment deadline.
